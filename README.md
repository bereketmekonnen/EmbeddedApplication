This is a C++ implementation of a video card. The program captures image data by using the onboard camera found on the DE10 Standard FPGA board. The program uses the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to receive instructions from a client. The instructions are then used to adjust the brightness and contrast values of the live video feed.
